Problem Identification: 
The risk of falls in elderly is a significant concern, which often results in severe complication like fractured hips, traumatic brain injuries and sometimes even death in absence of an immediate medical attention. This risk is further elevated when seniors live independently, exposing them to prolonged periods on the ground, increasing the likelihood of unconsciousness, hypothermia, or even fatal consequences. Utilization of Fall Detection System for immediate monitoring is essential in averting these dangers and minimizing injury risks.

Approach of This Project:
Our Primary objective has been the collection of the 3-axis acceleration and 3-axis rotational values through accelerometer and gyroscope. The raw data collected is then tabulated and this data is uploaded to a cloud platform. As soon as this data is found to be beyond threshold values, the system activates and waits for certain time to detect any significant movement in the person's body, if not found, then send message and email to caretaker or concerned person.
